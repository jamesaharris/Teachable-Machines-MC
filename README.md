# Teachable in Minecraft
This is an example of using Teachable machines (Googles basic AI) in Minecraft. The models were trained off of the internet and have about 20 - 50 data points each. I used a capture card plugged into a friends computer to present this, but its possible to run a virtual cap in OBS or something to mimic a webcam input for the AI.

# What is AI?
AI is an acronym, it stands for Artificial Inteligence. Its only pretending to be smart. AI mimics how a human would learn by taking in data that a human has said "This is ____" 

# Why?
This is part of  project for Biology where we were tasked to create an AI that could classify organisms. We decided to stand out some among the mass of people classifying my kingdom and made an AI classify in Minecraft.

# Credit where its due
I worked on this with a friend, Nathon Sanft, used a lot of W3schools for the HTML side, and of course used teachable machines. The idea did not come from us originally, the idea was yelled across the room as a joke and we went for it.
